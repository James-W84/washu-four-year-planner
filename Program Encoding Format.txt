This is the format of JSON I came up with: 
cse_major = {
    "name": "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science",
    "code": "BSCS",
    "degree": "BS",
    "school_code": "E",
    "dept_num": "81",  
    "dept_code":"CSE",
    "core_reqs": ['CSE 131', 'CSE 132', 'CSE 247', 
                ['CSE 240', 'Math 310'], 'CSE 332S', 'CSE 347', 'Math 131', 'Math 132', 'Math 233', 
                ['Math 309', 'ESE 318'], ['ESE 326', 'Math 3200', 'Math 3211', {'sequence': ['DAT 120', 'DAT 121']}]],
    "elective_reqs": [
        {"code": ['CSE ***A', 'CSE ***T', 'CSE ***M', 'CSE ***S'], "credits": 24},
        {"code": ['CSE ***A', 'CSE ***M'], "credits": 3},
        {"code": 'CSE ***T', "credits": 3},
    ],
    "attributes": [

        {"attr": "AS IQ: NSM", "credits": 8}
    ]
}

Degree corresponds to the type of degree being attained and will lead to requirements being chained on from the degree database.

The "core_reqs" array contains all requirements where a specific course or set of courses is specified. 
- In this array, if an element is a string, it is a required class with no alternatives. 
- If an element is an array, the array contains all the alternatives for a requirement, such as taking 'CSE 240' OR 'Math 310'. 
- If an array containing all the alternatives contains an element as an object with the attribute "sequence", then it is an alternative that contains a sequence of classes. 
- In this example, a student is required to take 'ESE 326', 'Math 3200', or 'Math 3211', or they can choose to take both 'DAT 120' and 'DAT 121'.

The 'elective_reqs' array contains requirements where specific courses are not described, but there is a certain range of courses that would fulfill this requirement. 
 - The element {"code": ['CSE ***A', 'CSE ***T', 'CSE ***M', 'CSE ***S'], "credits": 24}, for example, means that one is required to take 24 credits of courses that are formatted in any of the above ways. CSE 204A or CSE 332S would both count. 

The "attributes" array contains requirements that are based on attributes of courses. 
 - Most courses have attributes, and taking a course with an attribute counts towards satisfying the requirement of that attribute.
